		<h1 class="mainh1" style="padding:0px 64px;">Much of the what is done in Computer Science requires the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_programming_languages" style="text-decoration:none">Programming Languages</a>. A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.<br />The earliest computers were often programmed without the help of a programming language, by writing programs in absolute machine language. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards or magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer. Absolute machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages (1GL).<br />The next step was development of so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL) or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.<br />The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalk√ºl, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.</h1><br /><br /><br />
