		<h1 class="mainh1">Every day the same dream. <br />My actions: <br />I woke up and turned off the alarm. I got dressed. I found my wife in the kitchen and spoke to her. I turned off the TV, I then turned it back on. I walk to the elevator and press the button. I get into the elevator. I talk to the lady. I get off the elevator. I walk to my car. I drive a little bit and then get out. I walk backwards and find a cow which I pet. I keep walking back but I end up back at my car. I get in the car and keep driving. It is not possible to crash into other cars. I finish driving, get out, and see a tree with a leaf on it. The leaf falls off. I keep walking. I reach my work, talk to my boss, and walk towards my cubicle. I keep walking instead, past all the clones, and commit suicide. The game resets. I don't wear clothes this time and not muchs changes except my wife tells me to get dressed and my boss fires me.<br />
		Allowed interactions:<br />It seems as though the end goal is to face your boss and the job that you have, so it does not seem possible to avoid that, regardless of what choices you make. However, you can choose how that interaction plays out. If you are naked you get fired. If you choose to not sit down, you are given the choice to commit suicide. I think the point is to ensure that you reach the idea they want you to reach, that your job is awful and you should feel awful, but to give you different ways of dealing with it. However, the game also seems to want to show you that there is no escape from the dullness and mundanity, and keeps waking you up after each finished cycle.
		<br />Graphics: <br />The graphical quality is colorless, low in detail, and all around dull. I think it is delibarately done this way to make the game dull and gloomy, to help reinforce the points they are trying to make about being a corporate zombie clone, and how unfulfilling that life is.<br />
		Nature of Interactions: <br />The interactions seem pointless and meaningless and most of them have little to no change on the story. I think this is to emphasize that there is seemingly no escape from this dull life.
